# Parameter Guide

## Percussion
- `SWING` around 0.02–0.04 for a relaxed eighth-note feel.
- Ghost taps: lighten velocity and keep probability modest.
- Hats advance time; other hits stack with `beats=0`.

## Bassline
- Four-beat bar: center → small rise → fifth → turn.
- Use `BAR_DYN` to shape a four-bar breath.

## Picking
- Group pattern defined by three group sizes (see file).
- First note of each group anchors to the bar’s pedal.

## Melody
- `DENSITY` controls how many non-strong beats speak.
- Grace pairs appear on strong positions only.

## Chimes
- Phrase markers at chosen bars; keep them soft.
